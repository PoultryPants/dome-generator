## Dome Generator — Minecraft slabs & stairs

Try it online: https://poultrypants.github.io/dome-generator/

### How to Use

1. **Set Diameter:** Use the Diameter slider to choose the dome’s size.
2. **Adjust Cut:** The Cut slider lets you view only the lower layers, useful if you are trying to copy the design layer-by-layer.
3. **Pick Spheroid Type:** Select Sphere, Oblate, or Prolate. For non-spheres, the Eccentricity slider appears to fine-tune the shape.
4. **Corner Stairs Use:** Choose how corner stairs are placed for different block arrangements. Modes:
   - **None:** Won't use any corner stairs, only normal stairs
   - **Legal:** Uses corner stairs only in places where you could place them in survival Minecraft, without using a debug stick or commands
   - **All:** Uses corner stairs anywhere, even if it wouldn't be possible to place them there normally
5. **Ensure Symmetry:** Toggle this to force symmetric block placement.
6. **Preview:** The isometric canvas updates live as you change settings.

All controls are at the top. The canvas below shows a Minecraft-style preview of your dome. I am thinking of adding export options in the future as well.
